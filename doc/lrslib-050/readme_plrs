Setup instructions for plrs.

1. Install boost library from http://www.boost.org/ into prefix/boost151

If you haver root permission, prefix=/usr/include
However you can install boost locally wherever you like.
 
Instructions for installing the library are located here 
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html. 
Look at section 5 for an easy install. 
***Important: make a note of the path given at the end of the install process ****

2. After the boost library is installed merge the contents of boost-atomic directory (included in lrslib-050) 
with the corresponding directories in your boost prefix/include/boost151 directory.

3. Update the makefile to include the paths you recorded in step 1. 
 "make plrs" will make plrs with the gmp library (assuming the gmp library is already installed on that machine). 
 "make plrsmp" will make plrs with the standard lrsmp arithmetic library and plrs1 with the long integer library.
